This document provides a simple template of how the provided
\verb+iitmdiss.cls+ \LaTeX\ class is to be used.  Also provided are
several useful tips to do various things that might be of use when you
write your thesis. The template has been standardized in caompliance
with the new format guidelines released in Feb 2021. 

Before reading any further please note that you are strongly advised
against changing any of the formatting options used in the class
provided in this directory, unless you are absolutely sure that it
does not violate the IITM formatting guidelines.  \emph{Please do not
  change the margins or the spacing.}  If you do change the formatting
you are on your own (don't blame me if you need to reprint your entire
thesis).  In the case that you do change the formatting despite these
warnings, the least I ask is that you do not redistribute your style
files to your friends (or enemies). 

Also, since we are talking about the responsibility here, 
like any other piece of freely-distributable code, this template
and other files within this folder are provided “as is”, and there is 
no guarantee of any kind from the author. In short, that means, 
it is your personal responsibility to make sure the template is 
complaint with the guidelines, and I cannot be held responsible.


It is also a good idea to take a quick look at the formatting
guidelines.  Your office or advisor also should have a copy.  If they
don't, pester them, they really should have the formatting guidelines
readily available somewhere. I personally would strongly
suggest you to go through them even before you venture into the present
template. For convenience, the formatting guidelines have been included
in a separate folder along with other proformas required while 
submitting your synopsis or thesis.

To compile your sources run the following from the command line:
\begin{verbatim}
% latex thesis.tex
% bibtex thesis
% latex thesis.tex
% latex thesis.tex
\end{verbatim}
Modify this suitably for your sources. Or you can use standard \TeX environments
like \TeX Studio, \TeX Maker etc., to make this process way simpler.

To generate PDF's with the links from the \verb+hyperref+ package use
the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
% dvipdfm -o thesis.pdf thesis.dvi
\end{verbatim}

\section{Package Options}

Use this thesis as a basic template to format your thesis.  The
\verb+iitmdiss+ class can be used by simply using something like this:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[PhD]{iitmdiss}  
\end{verbatim}

For getting a print form of the same thesis, add the option \verb+PrntForm+ like:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[PhD,PrntForm]{iitmdiss}  
\end{verbatim}

There are also default color bars on the title page in the new format.
For PhD thesis, the default would be black, and for MS thesis, it is cyan-blue. 
As for other programmes, there has not been any specific guidelines on how to 
make the title page, so black has been set as default. There is also 'NoColor'
option you can give to not print this color bar.
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[PhD,PrntForm,NoColor]{iitmdiss}  
\end{verbatim}

To change the title page for different degrees just change the option
from \verb+PhD+ to one of \verb+MS+, \verb+MTech+, \verb+DD+, \verb+MBA+, \verb+MSc+ or \verb+BTech+.
The other specific degrees are not supported yet but should be quite easy
to add if you look at the code used to generate above degree pages in \verb+iitmdiss.cls+ file.  The title page formatting really depends on how large or
small your thesis title is.  Consequently it might require some hand
tuning.  Edit your version of \verb+iitmdiss.cls+ suitably to do this.
I recommend that this be done once your title is final.

The new format has an option to include a visually appealing figure/image
from your thesis. I have given the file name as \verb+titleImage.png+ for this
sample image from my work. So if you are planning to use it, place that image file 
in png format with the main folder and rename it as \verb+titleImage.png+. 
But if you are not happy with this concept, and want to include custom image formats or file name 
of your image/figure, and are comfortable in \LaTeX, I would suggest editing the \verb+iitmdiss.cls+.
Look for \verb+titleImage+ string, and start editing there. You can also 

To write a synopsis simply use the \verb+synopsis.tex+ file as a
simple template.  The synopsis option turns this on and can be used as
shown below:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[PhD,synopsis]{iitmdiss}                                
\end{verbatim}

For synopsis, the concept of 'Blue' or 'Yellow' tape to represent
the draft and approved reports has to be reflected on the title page
of respective documents in the new guidelines. Remember that there is a 
compliance-checking staff at the DR office who would ensure you submit it
with right color coding. Or else, you might have to re-make and re-submit
the report again. Options to give would be 'BlueTape' or 'YellowTape',
and can be used as shown below:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[PhD,synopsis,BlueTape]{iitmdiss}                                
\end{verbatim}

Like thesis, there is a 'NoColor' option for synopsis as well, but it won't
be that useful. Also default option gives black color bar.


If you want to modify spacing between the lines/text of the title page, again 
it can be easily done by editing the class file if you are familiar,
and may require some small amount of fine tuning.
 
 
This sample file uses the \verb+hyperref+ package that makes all
labels and references clickable in both the generated DVI and PDF
files.  These are very useful when reading the document online and do
not affect the output when the files are printed.


\section{Example Figures and tables}

Figure~\ref{fig:iitm} shows a simple figure for illustration along with
a long caption.  The formatting of the caption text is automatically
single spaced and indented.  Table~\ref{tab:sample} shows a sample
table with the caption placed correctly.  The caption for this should
always be placed before the table as shown in the example.

In the new format, emphasis has been made on the proper copyright compliance 
when reusing figures/images/tables from other authors and sources. Relevant
attributions and usage policy has to be included within the thesis certificate
page. An example has been provided for the usage of IIT Madras logo that 
is used as a sample figure in the present template.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \begin{center}
    \resizebox{50mm}{!} {\includegraphics *{iitmlogo.eps}}
    \resizebox{50mm}{!} {\includegraphics *{iitmlogo.eps}}
    \caption {Two IITM logos in a row.  This is also an
      illustration of a very long figure caption that wraps around two
      two lines.  Notice that the caption is single-spaced.}
  \label{fig:iitm}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{A sample table with a table caption placed
    appropriately. This caption is also very long and is
    single-spaced.  Also notice how the text is aligned.}
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}[c]{|c|r|} \hline
    $x$ & $x^2$ \\ \hline
    1  &  1   \\
    2  &  4  \\
    3  &  9  \\
    4  &  16  \\
    5  &  25  \\
    6  &  36  \\
    7  &  49  \\
    8  &  64  \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:sample}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Bibliography with BIB\TeX}

I strongly recommend that you use BIB\TeX\ to automatically generate
your bibliography.  It makes managing your references much easier.  It
is an excellent way to organize your references and reuse them.  You
can use one set of entries for your references and cite them in your
thesis, papers and reports.  If you haven't used it anytime before
please invest some time learning how to use it. Also you can use reference
managers like Mendeley, Zotero etc., to import these bib-formatted library
with all the references, making the citation process less painful. 
The \verb+refs.bib+ used in this template is one such example.

I've included a simple example BIB\TeX\ file along in this directory
called \verb+refs.bib+.  The \verb+iitmdiss.cls+ class package which
is used in this thesis and for the synopsis uses the \verb+natbib+
package to format the references along with a customized bibliography
style provided as the \verb+iitm.bst+ file in the directory containing
\verb+thesis.tex+.  Documentation for the \verb+natbib+ package should
be available in your distribution of \LaTeX.  Basically, to cite the
author along with the author name and year use \verb+\cite{key}+ where
\verb+key+ is the citation key for your bibliography entry.  You can
also use \verb+\citet{key}+ to get the same effect.  To make the
citation without the author name in the main text but inside the
parenthesis use \verb+\citep{key}+.  The following paragraph shows how
citations can be used in text effectively.

More information on BIB\TeX\ is available in the book by
\cite{lamport:86}, which is a citation for book. \cite{lamport1:86} is
the same book citation in the old format where the year comes at the end.
 Now to cite the references within parentheses. There are many 
references~\citep{lamport:86} that explain 
how to use BIB\TeX.  Read the \verb+natbib+ package documentation 
for more details on how to cite things differently.

Here are other references for example.  The present study has been 
carried out in OpenFOAM which is based on \cite{Weller1998}. 
The Lagrangian solver has two injection models based on the nature 
of injection source viz. \texttt{pointInjection} model which injects
the spray at a given point, and \texttt{detailed- SprayProfileInjection}
model which injects the spray over a spherical sector of given injection
radius. The configuration and experimental data to compare the spray
statistics is taken from \cite{Zhou2015a}

The above paragraphs had journal and book references.
Other sample references to check are: for thesis \cite{Syed2013,
Cheekati2014,Syed2020}, for conferences \cite{Sasidharan2017,Syed2018,
Syed2018a}, for manual \cite{Ayachit2015},  for book chapter \cite{Ahren2005}.
One more reference, \cite{Roenby2016} with arxiv and doi.

Python~\citep{py:python} is a programming language and is
cited here to show how to cite something that is best identified with
a URL. For technical report, \cite{Syed2015} is an example,
and \cite{UnitedNations2019} is an example of a non-technical report.

\section{Other useful \LaTeX\ packages}

The following packages might be useful when writing your thesis.

\begin{itemize}  
\item It is very useful to include line numbers in your document.
  That way, it is very easy for people to suggest corrections to your
  text.  I recommend the use of the \texttt{lineno} package for this
  purpose.  This is not a standard package but can be obtained on the
  internet.  The directory containing this file should contain a
  lineno directory that includes the package along with documentation
  for it.

\item The \texttt{listings} package should be available with your
  distribution of \LaTeX.  This package is very useful when one needs
  to list source code or pseudo-code.

\item For special figure captions the \texttt{ccaption} package may be
  useful.  This is specially useful if one has a figure that spans
  more than two pages and you need to use the same figure number.

\item The notation page can be entered manually or automatically
  generated using the \texttt{nomencl} package.

\end{itemize}

More details on how to use these specific packages are available along
with the documentation of the respective packages.
