	abstract = {One important aspect of the complex sprinkler protection process is the interaction between the water spray and the fire plume. In order to provide suitable data for the development and validation of a LES-based fire protection models, such as FireFOAM, a series of small-scale experiments were conducted to examine the interaction of hot air plumes and water sprays through combined gas-liquid velocity and droplet size measurements. Laser-based particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to acquire the spatially-resolved velocity data; and a shadow imaging system (SIS) was used to measure the water droplet size and volume flux. Hot air plumes with three convective heat release rates (1.6, 2.1 and 2.6 kW) were selected to interact with a water spray at a discharge rate of 0.084 Lpm. The velocity field of the hot air plume and ceiling flow with/without water spray, the droplet size and volume flux of water spray with/without hot air plume were measured. The interaction between the hot air plume and water spray was characterized by the location of the interaction boundary with the momentum ratio of the hot air to that of the spray. The results showed that that the momentum ratio and the evaporation effect due to hot air on the water droplets played a significant role to change the interaction structure and the ceiling layer pattern.},

@article{Weller1998,
	abstract = {In this article the principles of the field operation and manipulation (FOAM) C++class library for continuum mechanics are outlined. Our intention is to make it as easy as possible to develop reliable and efficient computational continuum-mechanics codes: this is achieved by making the top-level syntax of the code as close as possible to conventional mathematical notation for tensors and partial differential equations. Object-orientation techniques enable the creation of data types that closely mimic those of continuum mechanics, and the operator overloading possible in C++ allows normal mathematical symbols to be used for the basic operations. As an example, the implementation of various types of turbulence modeling in a FOAM computational-fluid-dynamics code is discussed, and calculations performed on a standard test case, that of flow around a square prism, are presented. To demonstrate the flexibility of the FOAM library, codes for solving structures and magnetohydrodynamics are also presented with appropriate test case results given.},

	abstract = {The FireFOAM solver uses the discrete-particle Lagrangian solver of OpenFOAM for simulations of the effect of spray on various suppression phenomena. Sub-models describing separate-effect physics are included in the solver. These models include physics for drag, heat transfer and evaporation. The present study was conducted for two main purposes: 1) to identify the mathematics behind each submodel, and 2) to verify if the models are implemented correctly. The analysis was divided into three parts, based on the nature of physical phenomena involved. The Lagrangian models have been applied in FireFOAM simulations and the results have been verified by comparing them with analytical results. Issues related to the verification process have been reported.},

	abstract = {Fundamental studies on both fire growth and fire suppression have direct implications on fire safety. Focusing on these aspects, the present work is an attempt to numerically study a buoyant flame and its interaction with a co-axial water-mist nozzle in counter-flow configuration using OpenFOAM. The buoyant flame is generated using circular burner of diameter 50mm and Methane as fuel, for flow rates of 10slpm and 20slpm. LES approach is used for the gas phase simulation with two different combustion models; one with the EDC concept and other uses finite rate chemistry. A Delavan CT 1.5-30 full cone nozzle, installed below a ceiling; co-axial and above the burner is used for producing the water-mist. The nozzle is simulated utilizing the Lagrangian module with a detailed spray profile, using experimental data from the literature. Both the flame and nozzle are studied separately, and with each other interacting. A detailed analysis of the air entrainment on either sides of nozzle shows a circulating flow for the case with flame-mist interaction, which is absent in the cases of flame or mist alone. Furthermore, comparison is made between the combustion models for the preliminary study of flame extinction using water-mist.},

	abstract = {The present work examines the fire behaviour of non-charring materials subjected to property variation using an unsteady numerical model. Fuel under study is non-charring thermo plastic PMMA since it is most common polymer studied in fire science. Pyrolysis is the key process in the burning of solid fuels since the rate at which material transforms into a gas phase fuel governs energy release rate in subsequent flames. The influence of various material properties like specimen thickness, absorption coefficient, density specific heat, heat of reaction, on various fire response parameters like MLR and ignition time is analysed. A quantitative assessment was carried out in the form of sensitivity study which highlights the simultaneous effect of thickness and heat flux on the solid fuel properties and was not explored in previous studies. Also, the background of Scaled Energy Balance approach gives better understanding of dynamics of pyrolysis. An amalgamated analysis of both will help us get more insight into various physical processes within pyrolysis and will help in the development of fire-retardant materials with general application in fire safety sciences},
